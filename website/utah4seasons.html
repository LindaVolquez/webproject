                    <p>Spring in Utah typically starts in March and lasts through May. As temperatures rise, snow begins to melt, leading to increased water flow in rivers and streams. Springtime is known for unpredictable weather, including rain showers, thunderstorms, and occasional snowfall in higher elevations. Fluctuating temperatures can cause rapid snowmelt, leading to potential flooding in some areas.</p>

                    <p>Winter in Utah lasts from December to February. Cold temperatures prevail, especially in higher elevations and mountainous regions where snowfall is frequent. Utah's renowned ski resorts thrive during the winter months, attracting visitors from around the world. Inversions are common during winter, particularly in the Salt Lake Valley, where cold air becomes trapped beneath a layer of warm air, leading to poor air quality and smog. Snowstorms can occur throughout the season, sometimes resulting in significant snow accumulation, which is essential for the state's water supply and winter recreation activities.</p>
